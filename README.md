# **Zeniq Solidity Contract Deployment**

## **Overview**

This repository is solely focused on the deployment of a Solidity contract on the Zeniq blockchain. The contract is responsible for deploying smart contracts and utilizes an environment variable containing our private key to execute this deployment.

## **Interaction with Artificial Intelligence**

The contract is designed to interact with our artificial intelligence system. Messages received are recorded on-chain, ensuring transparent and secure operations.

## **Sample Transactions**
